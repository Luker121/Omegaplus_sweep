# Selective Sweep Analysis in *Arabis nemorensis* and *Arabis sagittata*

This repository contains scripts, data files, and plots related to the identification of selective sweeps in *Arabis nemorensis* and *Arabis sagittata*. The analysis involves simulating demographic histories, detecting selective sweeps using OmegaPlus, and investigating the overlap between sweep regions and quantitative trait loci (QTLs).


## Project Overview

We identified selective sweeps using biallelic SNPs and the OmegaPlus software (Alachiotis et al., 2012). OmegaPlus statistics were calculated using a grid size of 200,000 bp, with minimum and maximum window sizes for computing linkage disequilibrium (LD) values set to 50 kb and 100 kb, respectively. Outlier omega statistics indicative of selective sweeps were determined based on the genome-wide distribution of values.

To minimize false positives arising from demographic processes, we established cut-off values for the omega statistics using forward simulations in SLiM4 (Haller et al.) under the demographic history inferred by Dittberner et al. (2022). The demography includes two pulses of interspecific gene flow between the species: an ancient pulse directly after the species split and a recent migration event between sympatric populations.

We generated 10,000 neutral datasets of 2 Mb each under the demographic history of ancient and recent migration between the two species, assuming a fixed recombination rate for each simulated block (5.5e-8). The maximum omega value from each simulated dataset was extracted, yielding a distribution of 10,000 maximum values. The 99th percentile of this distribution was used as the threshold to identify outlier windows indicative of selective sweeps.

To optimize sweep detection, we tested multiple combinations of grid, minwin, and maxwin parameters (from 50 kb to 200 kb for grid size, and 50 kb to 100 kb for minwin and maxwin). We then applied the optimized parameters to the real dataset of *Arabis nemorensis* and *Arabis sagittata*, extracting only the sweep regions that exceeded the simulation-based threshold, which were considered high-confidence selective sweep regions.

### plots/

#### `plot_overlap_QTLs_sweeps.R`

This R script visualizes the overlap between selective sweep regions identified by OmegaPlus and QTLs in *Arabis nemorensis* and *Arabis sagittata*.

### scripts/

#### `Arabis_divergent_model_singlepop_ancAndrecentMigration.slim`

This SLiM script simulates the demographic history of *Arabis nemorensis* and *Arabis sagittata*, incorporating both ancient and recent gene flow events. 
The simulation is based on the demographic history inferred by Dittberner et al. (2022) and includes:

- Two pulses of interspecific gene flow between the species:
  - An ancient pulse directly after the species split.
  - A recent migration event between sympatric populations.
- Generation of 10,000 neutral datasets of 2 Mb each.
- Assumption of a fixed recombination rate for each simulated block (5.5e-8).

The simulated data are used to establish cut-off values for the omega statistics to minimize false positives due to demographic processes.

## Analysis Workflow

1. **Simulation of Demographic History:**
   - Use `Arabis_divergent_model_singlepop_ancAndrecentMigration.slim` to simulate the demographic history and generate neutral datasets under the model of ancient and recent migration.

2. **Selective Sweep Detection on Simulated Data:**
   - Run `run_OmegaPlus_treesfile_simulatedData.py` to calculate omega statistics on the simulated datasets.
   - Extract the maximum omega values from each dataset to build a distribution for threshold determination.

3. **Threshold Determination:**
   - Use the distribution of maximum omega values from the simulations to determine the 99th percentile threshold.

4. **Selective Sweep Detection on Real Data:**
   - Run `run_OmegaPlus_vcf_files_realData.py` with optimized parameters to detect selective sweeps in the real genomic data.
   - Process the output files of OmegaPlus using `read_OmegaPlus_vcf_files.py`.

5. **Overlap Analysis with QTLs:**
   - Use `plot_overlap_QTLs_sweeps.R` to visualize the selective sweep regions and their overlap with QTLs.
   - Identify overlapping regions where selective sweeps and QTL peaks co-localize within a 200 kb window.
   - Focus on the 10% quantile regions around the QTL peak positions for increased specificity.

6. **Visualization and Interpretation:**
   - Generate plots to illustrate the likelihood profiles of selective sweeps and their association with phenotypic traits.
   - Interpret the results to pinpoint candidate genomic regions under selection.
